# Harmonic Scale Tuner
A Musescore plugin for tuning scores to the [Harmonic Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_scale).

## Features
This plugin can be used to tune the whole score, or only a portion of it, to the Harmonic scale.
For example, if the fundamental note is `C`, the tuning offset of the notes is:

| Note | Harmonic | Offset (Â¢) |
| :--: | -------: | ---------: |
| C | 16 | 0 |
